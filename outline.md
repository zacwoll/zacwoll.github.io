Hey, I'm Zachary Woll
Wool? Wall? (sheep) (brick wall)
Guess which one it is
? This could be fun, is it hard?

Good Guess!

This many people guessed the same as you did.

I am a programmer who cares about User Experience and User Interface
Just because our applications are complex doesn't mean they can't be easy to use. With most of the world's businesses moving online, more consumers than ever need to interact with *software:* A web site, a mobile app, even software developers need applications that are easy to use. I champion the user experience! We're in the future! Lets have our computers thank us, make our life easy, send us on our way with the satisfaction of a job well done.

I probably want to explain who I am so

I am musician (guitar / piano / drums / vocals)
Guitar pictures roll by on carousel

I am rock climber ( ropes, carabeaners, helmets )
Explain the coolest part
Rock Climbing is the pinnacle of physical and mental stimulation. Climbing is a rotation of arms and legs, repeated until you reach the summit. You have to keep your balance, so you use your arms to stay upright, and you have to carry the rest of yourself on your legs. A person's legs are typically far stronger than their arms, so this division of labor is very appropriate. The game of rock climbing is keeping your balance under control as you march up the wall, and there's no competition! Set your hands, stand on your feet, and plan the next move, keep it flowing.
